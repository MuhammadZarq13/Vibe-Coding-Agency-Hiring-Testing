    "You are tasked with creating an AI-powered system that can handle the complete lifecycle of code review and deployment pipeline management for a mid-size software company. The system needs to:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Pain Points:**\n",
    "- Manual code reviews take 2-3 days per PR\n",
    "- Inconsistent review quality across teams\n",
    "- Deployment failures due to missed edge cases\n",
    "- Security vulnerabilities slip through reviews\n",
    "- No standardized deployment process across projects\n",
    "- Rollback decisions are manual and slow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Requirements:**\n",
    "- Reduce review time to <4 hours for standard PRs\n",
    "- Maintain or improve code quality\n",
    "- Catch 90%+ of security vulnerabilities before deployment\n",
    "- Standardize deployment across 50+ microservices\n",
    "- Enable automatic rollback based on metrics\n",
    "- Support multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)\n",
    "- Handle both new features and hotfixes\n",

    "  - Output: Test execution results, coverage reports, test recommendations\n",
    "  - Success Criteria: All tests pass, coverage thresholds met\n",

    "### Question 1.2: Parallel vs Blocking Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parallel Operations:**\n",
    "- Security Analysis, Code Quality Analysis, and Architecture Review can run simultaneously\n",
    "- Automated Testing and Integration Validation can run in parallel after code analysis\n",
    "- Environment preparation for different environments (dev, staging, prod) can be parallelized\n",
    "- Health monitoring across different services can run concurrently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blocking Operations:**\n",
    "- Code Ingestion must complete before any analysis begins\n",
    "- All analysis phases must complete before testing begins\n",
    "- Testing must pass before deployment preparation\n",
    "- Deployment to staging must succeed before production deployment\n",
    "- Critical security findings must be resolved before any deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Decision Points:**\n",
    "1. **Security Gate:** If critical vulnerabilities found, block all further processing\n",
    "2. **Quality Gate:** If quality score below threshold, require manual review\n",
    "3. **Test Gate:** If tests fail, block deployment and require fixes\n",
    "4. **Integration Gate:** If integration issues detected, require resolution\n",
    "5. **Deployment Gate:** If deployment fails, trigger automatic rollback\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1.3: Key Handoff Points\n",

    "### Question 2.2: Challenging Scenarios Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code with Obscure Libraries/Frameworks\n",
    "**Strategy:**\n",
    "- Use multi-step analysis: first identify the library/framework, then research its security patterns\n",
    "- Implement fallback to generic security analysis when specific patterns aren't available\n",
    "- Create a knowledge base of obscure libraries with their specific security considerations\n",
    "- Use community resources and documentation to understand the library's security model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Enhancement:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you encounter an unfamiliar library or framework:\n",
    "1. First identify the library name and version\n",
    "2. Research its security model and common vulnerabilities\n",
    "3. Apply generic security principles (input validation, output encoding, etc.)\n",
    "4. Flag for manual review if confidence is low\n",
    "5. Suggest updating to well-known, maintained alternatives\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Security Reviews for Code\n",
    "**Strategy:**\n",
    "- Implement threat modeling as part of the analysis\n",
    "- Use multiple security analysis techniques (static analysis, pattern matching, semantic analysis)\n",
    "- Cross-reference with known vulnerability databases (CVE, NVD, OWASP)\n",
    "- Apply the principle of least privilege and defense in depth\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Enhancement:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "For security analysis, always consider:\n",
    "1. Attack surface and entry points\n",
    "2. Data flow and trust boundaries\n",
    "3. Authentication and authorization mechanisms\n",
    "4. Input validation and output encoding\n",
    "5. Error handling and information disclosure\n",
    "6. Cryptographic implementations\n",
    "7. Session management and state handling\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Analysis of Database Queries\n",
    "**Strategy:**\n",
    "- Analyze query patterns and execution plans\n",
    "- Check for N+1 queries, missing indexes, and inefficient joins\n",
    "- Consider database-specific optimizations\n",
    "- Use query complexity analysis and resource usage estimation\n",
    "\n",
