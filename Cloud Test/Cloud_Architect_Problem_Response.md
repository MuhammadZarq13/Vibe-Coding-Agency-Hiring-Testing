- **Input Requirements:** Code files, security rule database, vulnerability patterns, compliance standards
- **Output Format:** Security findings with severity levels, remediation suggestions, compliance status
- **Success Criteria:** 90%+ vulnerability detection rate, <5% false positives, OWASP Top 10 coverage
- **Failure Handling:** Escalate to human security expert, block deployment for critical issues, use baseline security rules

**Step 2.2: Code Quality Analysis Agent**
- **Input Requirements:** Code files, coding standards, best practices database, team preferences
- **Output Format:** Quality metrics, style violations, performance issues, maintainability scores
- **Success Criteria:** Consistent scoring across similar code patterns, team standard compliance

### Question 1.2: Parallel vs Blocking Operations

#### Parallel Operations:
- **Security Analysis, Code Quality Analysis, and Architecture Review** can run simultaneously after code ingestion
- **Automated Testing and Integration Validation** can run in parallel after code analysis
- **Environment preparation for different environments** (dev, staging, prod) can be parallelized
- **Health monitoring across different services** can run concurrently
- **Feedback collection from multiple sources** can be parallelized

#### Blocking Operations:
- **Code Ingestion** must complete before any analysis begins
- **All analysis phases** must complete before testing begins
- **Testing must pass** before deployment preparation
- **Deployment to staging** must succeed before production deployment
- **Critical security findings** must be resolved before any deployment
- **Environment preparation** must complete before deployment execution

#### Critical Decision Points:
1. **Security Gate:** If critical vulnerabilities found, block all further processing
2. **Quality Gate:** If quality score below threshold, require manual review
3. **Test Gate:** If tests fail, block deployment and require fixes
4. **Integration Gate:** If integration issues detected, require resolution
5. **Deployment Gate:** If deployment fails, trigger automatic rollback

### Question 1.3: Key Handoff Points

#### Handoff 1: Code Ingestion → Analysis Agents

### Question 2.2: Challenging Scenarios Handling

#### Code with Obscure Libraries/Frameworks
**Strategy:**
- Use multi-step analysis: first identify the library/framework, then research its security patterns
- Implement fallback to generic security analysis when specific patterns aren't available
- Create a knowledge base of obscure libraries with their specific security considerations
- Use community resources and documentation to understand the library's security model

**Prompt Enhancement:**
```
If you encounter an unfamiliar library or framework:
1. First identify the library name and version
2. Research its security model and common vulnerabilities
3. Apply generic security principles (input validation, output encoding, etc.)
4. Flag for manual review if confidence is low
5. Suggest updating to well-known, maintained alternatives
```

#### Security Reviews for Code
**Strategy:**
- Implement threat modeling as part of the analysis
- Use multiple security analysis techniques (static analysis, pattern matching, semantic analysis)
- Cross-reference with known vulnerability databases (CVE, NVD, OWASP)
- Apply the principle of least privilege and defense in depth

**Prompt Enhancement:**
```
For security analysis, always consider:
1. Attack surface and entry points
2. Data flow and trust boundaries
3. Authentication and authorization mechanisms
4. Input validation and output encoding
5. Error handling and information disclosure
6. Cryptographic implementations
7. Session management and state handling
```

#### Performance Analysis of Database Queries
**Strategy:**
- Analyze query patterns and execution plans
- Check for N+1 queries, missing indexes, and inefficient joins
- Consider database-specific optimizations
- Use query complexity analysis and resource usage estimation

**Prompt Enhancement:**
```
For database query analysis:
1. Identify query patterns and complexity
2. Check for missing indexes and inefficient joins
3. Analyze query execution plans when available
4. Look for N+1 query problems
5. Consider database-specific optimizations
6. Estimate resource usage and scalability impact
7. Suggest query optimization techniques
```

#### Legacy Code Modifications
**Strategy:**
- Understand the existing codebase architecture and patterns
- Identify technical debt and refactoring opportunities
- Balance between maintaining existing functionality and improving code quality
- Use incremental improvement approaches

**Prompt Enhancement:**
```
For legacy code modifications:
1. Understand the existing architecture and patterns
2. Identify technical debt and improvement opportunities
3. Balance new requirements with existing constraints
4. Suggest incremental refactoring approaches
5. Maintain backward compatibility where possible
6. Document breaking changes clearly
```

### Question 2.3: Ensuring Prompt Effectiveness

#### Consistency Measures:
1. **Prompt Versioning:** Track prompt versions and their performance metrics
2. **A/B Testing:** Test different prompt variations and measure outcomes
3. **Inter-rater Reliability:** Compare AI outputs with human expert reviews
4. **Confidence Scoring:** Require confidence scores for all outputs
5. **Feedback Loops:** Collect feedback on prompt effectiveness and iterate

#### Quality Assurance Process:
1. **Output Validation:** Check outputs against expected formats and ranges
2. **Consistency Checks:** Ensure similar inputs produce similar outputs
3. **Edge Case Testing:** Test prompts with various edge cases and error conditions
4. **Performance Monitoring:** Track response times, accuracy, and resource usage
5. **Continuous Improvement:** Regular prompt updates based on performance data

#### Monitoring and Metrics:
- **Accuracy Metrics:** True positive rate, false positive rate, precision, recall
- **Consistency Metrics:** Output variance, inter-rater agreement
- **Performance Metrics:** Response time, resource usage, throughput
- **User Satisfaction:** Feedback scores, manual override rates
- **Business Impact:** Time saved, quality improvements, deployment success rates
